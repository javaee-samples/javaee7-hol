== Show Booking (JavaServer Faces)

*Purpose*: Build pages that allow a user to book a particular movie show
in a theater. In doing so a new feature of JavaServer Faces 2.2 will be
introduced and demonstrated by using in the application.

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

JavaServer Faces 2.2 introduces a new feature called _Faces Flow_ that
provides an encapsulation of related views/pages with application
defined entry and exit points. Faces Flow borrows core concepts from ADF
TaskFlow, Spring Web Flow, and Apache MyFaces CODI.

It introduces `@FlowScoped` CDI annotation for flow-local storage and
`@FlowDefinition` to define the flow using CDI producer methods. There are
clearly defined entry and exit points with well-defined parameters. This
allows the flow to be packaged together as a JAR or ZIP file and be
reused. The application thus becomes a collection of flows and non-flow
pages. Usually the objects in a flow are designed to allow the user to
accomplish a task that requires input over a number of different views.

This application will build a flow that allows the user to make a movie
reservation. The flow will contain four pages:

*  Display the list of movies
*  Display the list of available show timings
*  Confirm the choices
*  Make the reservation and show the ticket

Lets build the application.

. Items in a flow are logically related to each other and so it is
required to keep them together in a directory. In NetBeans, right-click
on the `Web Pages', select `New', `Folder', specify the folder name
`booking', and click on `Finish'.
+
. Right-click on the newly created folder, select `New', `Facelets
Template Client', give the File Name as `booking'. Click on `Browse'
next to `Template:', expand `Web Pages', `WEB-INF', select
`template.xhtml', and click on `Select File'. Click on `Finish'.
+
. `booking.xhtml' is the entry point to the flow (more on this later).
+
In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections with `top' and `left' name
attributes. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <h2>Pick a movie</h2>
    <h:form prependId="false">
        <h:selectOneRadio 
            value="#{booking.movieId}"
            layout="pageDirection"
            required="true">
            <f:selectItems
                value="#{movieFacadeREST.all}"
                var="m"
                itemValue="#{m.id}"
                itemLabel="#{m.name}"/>
        </h:selectOneRadio>
        <h:commandButton id="shows" value="Pick a time" action="showtimes" />
    </h:form>
</ui:define>
----
+
The code builds an HTML form that displays the list of movies as radio
button choices. The chosen movie is bound to `#{booking.movieId}` which
will be defined as a flow-scoped bean. The value of action attribute on
commandButton refers to the next view in the flow, i.e.
`showtimes.xhtml' in the same directory in our case.
+
Click on the yellow bulb as shown and click on the suggestion to
add namespace prefix/URI mapping for `h:`. Repeat the same for `f:` prefix as well.
+

+
. Right-click on `Source Packages', select `New', `Java Class'.
Specify the class name as `Booking' and the package name as
`org.javaee7.movieplex7.booking'.
+
Add `@Named` class-level annotation to make the class EL-injectable.
+
Add `@FlowScoped("booking")` to define the scope of bean as the flow. The bean
is automatically activated and passivated as the flow is entered or exited.
+
Add the following field:
+
[source, java]
int movieId;
+
and generate getters/setters by going to `Source', `Insert Code',
selecting `Getter and Setter', and select the field.
+
Inject `EntityManager` in this class by adding the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
@PersistenceContext
EntityManager em;
----
+
Add the following convenience method:
+
[source, java]
----
public String getMovieName() {
    try {
        return em.createNamedQuery("Movie.findById", Movie.class)
                  .setParameter("id", movieId)
                  .getSingleResult()
                  .getName();
    } catch (NoResultException e) {
        return "";
    }
}
----
+
This method will return the movie name based upon the selected movie.
+
Alternatively, movie id and name may be passed from the selected radio
button and parsed in the backing bean. This will reduce an extra trip to
the database.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Create `showtimes.xhtml' in the `booking' folder following the
steps used to create `booking.xhtml'.
+
In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections with `top' and `left' name
attributes. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <h2>Show Timings for <font color="red">#{booking.movieName}</font></h2>
    <h:form>
        <h:selectOneRadio value="#{booking.startTime}" layout="pageDirection" required="true">
            <c:forEach items="#{timeslotFacadeREST.all}" var="s">
                <f:selectItem itemValue="#{s.id},#{s.startTime}" itemLabel="#{s.startTime}"/>
            </c:forEach>
        </h:selectOneRadio>
        <h:commandButton value="Confirm" action="confirm" />
        <h:commandButton id="back" value="Back" action="booking" immediate="true"/>
    </h:form>
</ui:define>
----
+
This code builds an HTML form that displays the chosen movie name and
all the show times. `#{timeslotFacadeREST.all}` returns the list of all
the movies and iterates over them using a `c:forEach` loop. The id and
start time of the selected show are bound to `#{booking.startTime}`.
Command button with value `Back' allows going back to the previous page and
the other command button with value `Confirm' takes to the next view in the
flow, `confirm.xhtml' in our case.
+
Typically a user will expect the show times only for the selected movie
but all the show times are shown here. This allows us to demonstrate
going back and forth within a flow if an incorrect show time for a movie
is chosen. A different query may be written that displays only the shows
available for this movie; however this is not part of the application.
+
Right-click on the yellow bulb to fix namespace prefix/URI mapping for 
`h:`. This needs to be repeated for `c:` and `f:` prefix as well.
+
. Add the following fields to the `Booking` class:
+
[source, java]
----
String startTime;
int startTimeId;
----
+
And the following methods:
+
[source, java]
----
public String getStartTime() {
    return startTime;
}

public void setStartTime(String startTime) {
    StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(startTime, ",");
    startTimeId = Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken());
    this.startTime = tokens.nextToken();
}

public int getStartTimeId() {
    return startTimeId;
}
----
+
These methods will parse the values received from the form. Also add the
following method:
+
[source, java]
----
public String getTheater() {
    // for a movie and show
    try {

        // Always return the first theater
        List<ShowTiming> list =
            em.createNamedQuery("ShowTiming.findByMovieAndTimingId",
                ShowTiming.class)
                .setParameter("movieId", movieId)
                .setParameter("timingId", startTimeId)
                .getResultList();

        if (list.isEmpty())
            return "none";

        return list
                .get(0)
                .getTheaterId()
                .getId()
                .toString();
    } catch (NoResultException e) {
        return "none";
    }
}
----
+
This method will find the first theater available for the chosen movie
and show the timing.
+
Additionally a list of theaters offering that movie may be shown in a
separate page.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Create `confirm.xhtml' page in the `booking' folder by following
the steps used to create ‘booking.xhtml’.
+
In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections wht `top' and `left' name
attributes. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>' section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <c:choose>
        <c:when test="#{booking.theater == 'none'}">
            <h2>No theater found, choose a different time</h2>
            <h:form>
                Movie name: #{booking.movieName}<p/>
                Starts at: #{booking.startTime}<p/>
                <h:commandButton id="back" value="Back" action="showtimes"/>
            </h:form>
        </c:when>
        <c:otherwise>
            <h2>Confirm ?</h2>
            <h:form>
                Movie name: #{booking.movieName}<p/>
                Starts at: #{booking.startTime}<p/>
                Theater: #{booking.theater}<p/>
                <h:commandButton id="next" value="Book" action="print"/>
                <h:commandButton id="back" value="Back" action="showtimes"/>
            </h:form>
        </c:otherwise>
    </c:choose>
</ui:define>
----
+
The code displays the selected movie, show timing, and theater if
available. The reservation can proceed if all three are available.
`print.xhtml' is the last page that shows the confirmed reservation
and is shown when `Book' commandButton is clicked.
+
`actionListener` can be added to `commandButton` to invoke the business
logic for making the reservation. Additional pages may be added to take
the credit card details and email address.
+
Right-click on the yellow bulb to fix namespace prefix/URI mapping for ‘c:’.
This needs to be repeated for ‘h:’ prefix as well.
+
. Create `print.xhtml' page in the `booking' folder by following the
steps used to create ‘booking.xhtml’.
+
In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections wht `top' and `left' name 
attributes. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <h2>Reservation Confirmed</h2>
    <h:form>
        Movie name: #{booking.movieName}<p/>
        Starts at: #{booking.startTime}<p/>
        Theater: #{booking.theater}<p/>
        <h:commandButton id="home" value="home" action="goHome" /><p/>
    </h:form>
</ui:define>
----
+
This code displays the movie name, show timings, and the selected
theater.
+
Right-click on the yellow bulb to fix namespace prefix/URI mapping for ‘h:’.
+
The `commandButton` initiates exit from the flow. The `action` attribute
defines a navigation rule that will be defined in the next step.
+
. `booking.xhtml', `showtimes.xhtml', `confirm.xhtml', and
`print.xhtml' are all in the same directory. Now the runtime needs to be
informed that the views in this directory are to be treated as view
nodes in a flow. This can be done declaratively by adding `booking/booking-flow.xml'
or programmatically by having a class with a method with the following annotations:
+
[source, java]
@Produces @FlowDefinition
+
This lab takes the declarative approach.
+
Right-click on `Web Pages/booking' folder, select `New', `Other', `XML',
`XML Document', give the name as `booking-flow', click on `Next>', take
the default of `Well-formed Document', and click on `Finish'.
+
Replace the generated code with the following:
+
[source, xml]
----
<faces-config
    version="2.2"
    xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_2.xsd">
    <flow-definition id="booking">
        <flow-return id="goHome">
        <from-outcome>/index</from-outcome>
        </flow-return>
    </flow-definition>
</faces-config>
----
+
This defines the flow graph. It uses the parent element used in
a standard `faces-config.xml` but defines a `<flow-definition>` inside it.
+
`<flow-return>` defines a return node in a flow graph. `<from-outcome>`
contains the node value, or an EL expression that defines the node, to
return to. In this case, the navigation returns to the home page.
+
. Finally, invoke the flow by editing `WEB-INF/template.xhtml' and
changing:
+
[source, xml]
<h:commandLink action="item1">Item 1</h:commandLink>
+
to
+
[source, xml]
<h:commandLink action="booking">Book a movie</h:commandLink>
+
`commandLink` renders an HTML anchor tag that behaves like a form submit
button. The action attribute points to the directory where all views for
the flow are stored. This directory already contains `booking-flow.xml'
which defines the flow of the pages.
+
. Run the project by right clicking on the project and selecting
`Run'. The browser shows the updated output.
+

+
Click on `Book a movie' to see the page as shown.
+
image:images/9.11-output2.png[image]
+
Select a movie, say `The Shiningr and click on `Pick a time' to see the
page output as shown.
+
image:images/9.11-output3.png[image]
+
Pick a time slot, say `04:00', click on `Confirm' to see the output as shown.
+
image:images/9.11-output4.png[image]
+
Click on `Book' to confirm and see the output as:
+
image:images/9.11-output5.png[image]
+
Feel free to enter other combinations, go back and forth in the flow and
notice how the values in the bean are preserved.
+
Click on `home' takes to the main application page.
