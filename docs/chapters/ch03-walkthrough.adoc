[[walk-through]]
== Walk-through of Sample Application

*Purpose*: This section will download the sample application to be used
in this hands-on lab. A walk-through of the application will be
performed to provide an understanding of the application architecture.

*Estimated Time*: 15-30 mins

. Download the sample application from
https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-hol/blob/master/starting-template/movieplex7-starting-template.zip?raw=true[movieplex7-starting-template.zip]
and unzip. This will create a `movieplex7' directory and unzips all the
content there.
+
. In NetBeans IDE, select `File', `Open Project', select the
unzipped directory, and click on `Open Project'. The project structure
is shown.
+
image::images/3.2-project-structure.png[Project Structure in NetBeans]
+
. Maven Coordinates: Expand `Project Files' and double click on
`pom.xml'. In the `pom.xml', the Java EE 7 API is specified as a
<dependency>:
+
[source,xml]
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax</groupId>
        <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>7.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
+
This will ensure that Java EE 7 APIs are retrieved from the central
Maven repository.
+
[NOTE]
=================
The Java EE 6 platform introduced the notion of `profiles'. A profile is
a configuration of the Java EE platform targeted at a specific class of
applications. All Java EE profiles share a set of common features, such
as naming and resource injection, packaging rules, security
requirements, etc. A profile may contain a proper subset or superset of
the technologies contained in the platform.

The Java EE Web Profile is a profile of the Java EE Platform
specifically targeted at modern web applications. The complete set of
specifications defined in the Web Profile is defined in the Java EE 7
Web Profile Specification.
=================
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
GlassFish can be downloaded in two different flavors – Full Platform or Web Profile.
endif::server-glassfish[]
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
WildFly can be started in Full Platform or Web Profile.
endif::server-wildfly[]
+
IMPORTANT: This lab requires Full Platform download. All technologies used in this
lab, except Java Message Service and Batch Applications for the Java
Platform, can be deployed on Web Profile.
+
. *Default Data Source*: Expand `Other Sources',
`src/main/resources', `META-INF', and double-click on `persistence.xml'.
By default, NetBeans opens the file in Design View. Click on `Source' tab
to view the XML source.
+
image::images/3.2-persistence-xml.png[persistence.xml]
+
It looks like:
+
[source,xml]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence
    version="2.1"
    xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence"

        <!--
            <jta-data-source>java:comp/DefaultDataSource</jta-data-source>
        -->
        <properties>
            <property
                name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action"
                value="drop-and-create"/>
            <property
                name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source"

                value="script"/>
            <property

                value="META-INF/drop.sql"/>
            <property
                name="javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source"

            <property
                name="eclipselink.deploy-on-startup"
                value="true"/>
            <property
                name="eclipselink.logging.exceptions"
                value="false"/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
+
Notice `<jta-data-source>` is commented out, i.e. no data source element
is specified. This element identifies the JDBC resource to connect to in
the runtime environment of the underlying application server.
+
The Java EE 7 platform defines a new default data source that must be
provided by the runtime. This pre-configured data source is accessible
under the JNDI name
+
[source,java]
java:comp/DefaultDataSource
+
The JPA 2.1 specification says if neither `jta-data-source` nor
`non-jta-data-source` elements are specified, the deployer must specify a
JTA data source or the default JTA data source must be provided by the
container.
+
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
For WildFly 8, the default data source is bound to the JDBC resource `what name`.
endif::server-wildfly[]
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
For GlassFish 4, the default data source is bound to the JDBC resource
`jdbc/__default`.
endif::server-glassfish[]
+
Clicking back and forth between `Design' and `Source' view may prompt
the error shown below:
+
image::images/3.4-missing-server.png[Missing Server for persistence.xml]
+
This will get resolved when we run the application. Click on `OK' to
dismiss the dialog.
+
. *Schema Generation:* JPA 2.1 defines a new set of
`javax.persistence.schema-generation.*` properties that can be used to
generate database artifacts like tables, indexes, and constraints in a
database schema. This helps in prototyping of your application where the
required artifacts are generated either prior to application deployment
or as part of `EntityManagerFactory` creation. This feature will allow
your JPA domain object model to be directly generated in a database. The
generated schema may need to be tuned for actual production environment.
+
The ``persistence.xml'' in the application has the following
`javax.persistence.schema-generation.*` properties. Their meaning and
possible values are explained:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Property |Meaning |Values

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action`
| Specifies the action to be taken by the persistence provider with regard
to the database artifacts.
| `none`, `create`, `drop-and-create`, `drop`

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source`
 `javax.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source`
| Specifies whether the creation or deletion of database artifacts is to
occur on the basis of the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL
script, or a combination of the two.
| `metadata`, `script`, `metadata-then-script`, `script-then-metadata`

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source`
 `javax.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source`
| Specifies a `java.IO.Reader` configured for reading of the SQL script or a
string designating a file URL for the SQL script to create or delete
database artifacts.
|

| `javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source`
| Specifies a `java.IO.Reader` configured for reading of the SQL load script
for database initialization or a string designating a file URL for the
script.
|
|===
+
Refer to the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[JPA 2.1 Specification]
for a complete understanding of these properties.
+
In the application, the scripts are bundled in the WAR file in
`META-INF' directory. As the location of these scripts is specified as a
URL, the scripts may be loaded from outside the WAR file as well.
+
Feel free to open `create.sql', `drop.sql' and `load.sql' and read
through the SQL scripts. The database schema is shown.
+
image::images/3.5-schema.png[Database Schema]
+
This folder also contains `sales.csv' which carries some comma-separated
data, and is used later in the application.
+
. *JPA entities, Stateless EJBs, and REST endpoints*: Expand `Source
Packages'. The package `org.javaee7.movieplex7.entities` contains the
JPA entities corresponding to the database table definitions. Each JPA
entity has several convenient `@NamedQuery` defined and uses Bean
Validation constraints to enforce validation.
+
The package `org.javaee7.movieplex7.rest` contains stateless EJBs
corresponding to different JPA entities.
+
Each EJB has methods to perform CRUD operations on the JPA entity and
convenience query methods. Each EJB is also EL-injectable (@Named) and
published as a REST endpoint (@Path). The AplicationConfig class defines
the base path of REST endpoint. The path for the REST endpoint is the
same as the JPA entity class name.
+
The mapping between JPA entity classes, EJB classes, and the URI of the
corresponding REST endpoint is shown.
+
[options="header"]
|===
| JPA Entity Class | EJB Class | RESTful Path

| `Movie`
| `MovieFacadeREST`
| /webresources/movie

| `Sales`
| `SalesFacadeREST`
| /webresources/sales

| `ShowTiming`
| `ShowTimingFacadeREST`
| /webresources/showtiming

| `Theater`
| `TheaterFacadeREST`
| /webresources/theater

| `Timeslot`
| `TimeslotFacadeREST`
| /webresources/timeslot
|===
+
Feel free to browse through the code.
+
. *JSF pages*: `WEB-INF/template.xhtml' defines the template of the
web page and has a header, left navigation bar, and a main content
section. `index.xhtml' uses this template and the EJBs to display the
number of movies and theaters.
+
Java EE 7 enables CDI discovery of beans by default. No `beans.xml' is
required in `WEB-INF'. This allows all beans with bean defining
annotation, i.e. either a bean with an explicit CDI scope or EJBs to be
available for injection.
+
Note, `template.xhtml' is in `WEB-INF' folder as it allows the template
to be accessible from the pages bundled with the application only. If it
were bundled with rest of the pages then it would be accessible outside
the application and thus allowing other external pages to use it as
well.
+
. *Run the sample*: Right-click on the project and select `Run'.
This will download all the maven dependencies on your machine, build a
WAR file, deploy on 
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
GlassFish 4
endif::server-glassfish[]
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
WildFly 8
endif::server-wildfly[]
, and show the URL
http://localhost:8080/movieplex7[localhost:8080/movieplex7] in the
default browser configured in NetBeans. Note that this could take a
while if you have never built a Maven application on your machine.
+
TIP: The project will show red squiggly lines in the source code indicating
that the classes cannot be resolved. This is expected before the
dependencies are downloaded. However these references will be resolved
correctly after the dependencies are downloaded during project building.
+
During the first run, the IDE will ask you to select a deployment server.
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
Choose the configured WildFly server and click on `OK'.
+
image::images/3.6-wildfly-server.png[WildFly Server]
endif::server-wildfly[]
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
Choose the configured GlassFish server and click on `OK'.
+
image::images/3.6-glassfish-server.png[GlassFish Server]
endif::server-glassfish[]
+
The output looks like as shown.
