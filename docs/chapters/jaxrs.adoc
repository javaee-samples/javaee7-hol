== View and Delete Movie (Java API for RESTful Web Services)

*Purpose*: View, and delete a movie. In doing so several new features of
JAX-RS 2 will be introduced and demonstrated by using them in the
application.

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

JAX-RS 2 defines a standard API to create, publish, and invoke a REST
endpoint. JAX-RS 2 adds several new features to the API:

* Client API that can be used to access Web resources and provides
integration with JAX-RS Providers. Without this API, the users need to
use a low-level HttpUrlConnection to access the REST endpoint.
* Asynchronous processing capabilities in Client and Server that enables
more scalable applications.
* Message Filters and Entity Interceptors as well-defined extension
points to extend the capabilities of an implementation.
* Validation constraints can be specified to validate the parameters and
return type.

This section will provide the ability to view all the movies, details of
a selected movie, and delete an existing movie using the JAX-RS Client
API.

. Right-click on `Source Packages', select `New', `Java Class'.
Give the class name as `MovieClientBean', package as
`org.javaee7.movieplex7.client', and click on `Finish'.
+
This bean will be used to invoke the REST endpoint.
+
. Add `@Named` and `@RequestScoped` class-level annotations. This allows
the class to be injected in an EL expression and also defines the bean
to be automatically activated and passivated with the request.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
WARNING: Make sure to pick `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` class.

+
. Add the following code to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
Client client;
WebTarget target;

@Inject HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest;

@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
    target = client
                .target("http://" +
                httpServletRequest.getLocalName() +
                ":" +
                httpServletRequest.getLocalPort() +
                "/" +
                httpServletRequest.getContextPath() +
                "/webresources/movie/");

}

@PreDestroy
public void destroy() {
    client.close();
}
----
+
`ClientBuilder` is the main entry point to the Client API. It uses a
fluent builder API to invoke REST endpoints. A new `Client` instance is
created using the default client builder implementation provided by the
JAX-RS implementation provider. Client are heavy-weight objects that
manage the client-side communication infrastructure. It is highly
recommended to create only required number of instances of Client and
close it appropriately.
+
In this case, `Client` instance is created and destroyed in the lifecycle
callback methods. The endpoint URI is set on this instance by calling
the target method. Note that the endpoint address is dynamically created
by injecting an instance of `HttpServletRequest`. This is a new feature
added in CDI 1.1
+
. Add the following method to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
public Movie[] getMovies() {
    return target
        .request()
        .get(Movie[].class);
}
----
+
A request is prepared by calling the request method. HTTP GET method is
invoked by calling get method. The response type is specified in the
last method call and so return value is of the type `Movie[]`.
+
. Right-click on `Web Pages', select `New', `Folder', specify the
name as `client', and click on `Finish'.
+
Right-click on the newly created folder, select `New', `Other',
`JavaServer Faces', `Facelets Template Client', and click on `Next >'.
+
Give the File Name as `movies'. Click on `Browse' next to `Template:',
expand `Web Pages', `WEB-INF', select `template.xhtml', and click on
`Select File'. Click on `Finish'.
+
. In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections where name attribute value is
`top' and `left'. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <h:form prependId="false">
        <h:selectOneRadio value="#{movieBackingBean.movieId}" layout="pageDirection">
            <c:forEach items="#{movieClientBean.movies}" var="m">
                <f:selectItem itemValue="#{m.id}" itemLabel="#{m.name}"/>
            </c:forEach>
        </h:selectOneRadio>
        <h:commandButton value="Details" action="movie" />
    </h:form>
</ui:define>
----
+
This code fragment invokes `getMovies` method from `MovieClientBean`,
iterates over the response in a for loop, and display the name of each
movie with a radio button. The selected radio button value is bound to
the EL expression `#{movieBackingBean.movieId}`.
+
The code also has a button with `Details' label and looks for
`movie.xhtml' in the same directory. We will create this file later.
+
Click on the yellow bulb in the left bar to resolve the namespace
prefix-to-URI resolution. This needs to be completed for `h:`, `c:`,
and `f:` prefixes.
+

+
. Right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.client' package, select
`New', `Java Class', specify the value as `MovieBackingBean' and click
on `Finish'.
+
Add the following field:
+
[source, java]
int movieId;
+
Add getters/setters by right-clicking on the editor pane and selecting
`Insert Code' (Ctrl + I shortcut on Mac). Select the field and click on
`Generate'.
+
Add `@Named` and `@SessionScoped` class-level annotations and implements
`Serializable`.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
WARNING: Make sure to import `javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped`.
+
. In `template.xhtml', add the following code along with other <outputLink>s:
+
[source, xml]
----
<p/><h:outputLink
        value="${facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/faces/client/movies.xhtml">
        Movies
    </h:outputLink>
----
+
Running the project (Fn + F6 shortcut on Mac) and clicking on `Movies'
in the left navigation bar shows the output as shown.
+
image::images/6.8-output.png[image]
+
The list of all the movies with a radio button next to them is
displayed.
+
. In `MovieClientBean`, inject `MovieBackingBean` to read the value
of selected movie from the page. Add the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
MovieBackingBean bean;
----
+
. In `MovieClientBean`, add the following method:
+
[source, java]
----
public Movie getMovie() {
    Movie m = target
        .path("{movie}")
        .resolveTemplate("movie", bean.getMovieId())
        .request()
        .get(Movie.class);
    return m;
}
----
+
This code reuses the `Client` and `WebTarget` instances created in
`@PostConstruct`. It also adds a variable part to the URI of the REST
endpoint, defined using `{movie}`, and binds it to a concrete value using
`resolveTemplate` method. The return type is specified as a parameter to
the get method.
+
. Right-click on `client' folder, select `New', `Facelets Template
Client', give the File Name as `movie'. Click on `Browse' next to
`Template:', expand `Web Pages', `WEB-INF', select `template.xhtml', and
click on `Select File'. Click on `Finish'.
+
. In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections where name attribute value is
`top' and `left'. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:define name="content">
    <h1>Movie Details</h1>
    <h:form>
        <table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Id:</th>
                <td>#{movieClientBean.movie.id}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Name:</th>
                <td>#{movieClientBean.movie.name}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Actors:</th>
                <td>#{movieClientBean.movie.actors}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h:commandButton value="Back" action="movies" />
    </h:form>
</ui:define>
----
+
Click on the yellow-bulb to resolve the namespace prefix-URI mapping for
`h:`.
+
The output values are displayed by calling the `getMovie` method and
using the `id`, `name`, and `actors` property values.
+
. Run the project, select `Movies' in the left navigation bar,
select a radio button next to any movie, and click on details to see the
output as shown.
+
image::images/6.12-output.png[image]
+
Click on the `Back' button to select another movie.
+
. Add the ability to delete a movie. In `movies.xhtml', add the
following code with other <commandButton>.
+
[source, xml]
----
<h:commandButton
    value="Delete"
    action="movies"
    actionListener="#{movieClientBean.deleteMovie()}"/>
----
+
This button displays a label `Delete', invokes the method deleteMovie
from `MovieClientBean', and then renders `movies.xhtml'.
+
. Add the following code to `MovieClientBean':
+
[source, java]
----
public void deleteMovie() {
    target
        .path("{movieId}")
        .resolveTemplate("movieId", bean.getMovieId())
        .request()
        .delete();
}
----
+
This code again reuses the `Client` and `WebTarget` instances created in
`@PostConstruct`. It also adds a variable part to the URI of the REST
endpoint, defined using `{movieId}`, and binds it to a concrete value
using `resolveTemplate` method. The URI of the resource to be deleted is
prepared and then delete method is called to delete the resource.
+
Make sure to resolve the imports.
+
Running the project shows the output shown.
+
image::images/6.14-output.png[image]
+
Select a movie and click on Delete button. This deletes the movie from
the database and refreshes list on the page. Note that a redeploy of the
project will delete all the movies anyway and add them all back.
