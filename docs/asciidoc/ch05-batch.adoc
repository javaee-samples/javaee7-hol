== Ticket Sales (Batch Applications for the Java Platform)

 +

*Purpose*: Read the total sales for each show and populate the database.
In doing so several new features of Java API for Batch Processing 1.0
will be introduced and demonstrated by using them in the application.

 +

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

 +

Batch Processing is execution of series of "jobs" that is suitable for
non-interactive, bulk-oriented and long-running tasks. Batch
Applications for the Java Platform (JSR 352) will define a programming
model for batch applications and a runtime for scheduling and executing
jobs.

 +

 +

The core concepts of Batch Processing are:

 +

* A *Job* is an instance that encapsulates an entire batch process. A
job is typically put together using a Job Specification Language and
consists of multiple steps. The Job Specification Language for JSR 352
is implemented with XML and is referred as "Job XML".
* A *Step* is a domain object that encapsulates an independent,
sequential phase of a job. A step contains all of the information
necessary to define and control the actual batch processing.
* *JobOperator* provides an interface to manage all aspects of job
processing, including operational commands, such as start, restart, and
stop, as well as job repository commands, such as retrieval of job and
step executions.
* *JobRepository* holds information about jobs current running and jobs
that run in the past. JobOperator provides access to this repository.
* Reader-Processor-Writer pattern is the primary pattern and is called
as *Chunk-oriented** **Processing*. In this, *ItemReader* reads one item
at a time, *ItemProcessor* processes the item based upon the business
logic, such as calculate account balance and hands it
to *ItemWriter* for aggregation. Once the 'chunk' numbers of items are
aggregated, they are written out, and the transaction is committed.

 +

This section will read the cumulative sales for each show from a CSV
file and populate them in a database.

 +

 +

*5.1* Right-click on Source Packages, select “New”, “Java Package…”,
specify the value as “org.glassfish.movieplex7.batch”, and click on
“Finish”.

 +

 +

*5.2* Right-click on newly created package, select “New”, “Java Class…”,
specify the name as “SalesReader”. Make this class extend from
AbstractItemReader, change the class definition and add:

 +

extends AbstractItemReader

 +

AbstractItemReader is an abstract class that implements ItemReader
interface. The ItemReader interface defines methods that read a stream
of items for chunk processing. This reader implementation returns a
String item type as indicated in the class definition.

 +

Add @Named as a class-level annotations and it allows the bean to be
injected in Job XML. Add @Dependent as another class-level annotation to
mark this bean as a bean defining annotation so that this bean is
available for injection.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.3* Add the following field:

 +

private BufferedReader reader;

 +

Override open() method to initialize the reader:

 +

public void open(Serializable checkpoint) throws Exception \{

reader = new BufferedReader(

new InputStreamReader(

Thread.currentThread()

.getContextClassLoader()

.getResourceAsStream("META-INF/sales.csv")));

}

 +

This method initializes a BufferedReader from “META-INF/sales.csv” that
is bundled with the application.

 +

 +

Sampling of the first few lines from “sales.csv” is shown below:

 +

1,500.00

2,660.00

3,80.00

4,470.00

5,1100.x0

 +

Each line has a show identifier comma separated by the total sales for
that show. Note that the last line (5^th^ record in the sample) has an
intentional typo. In addition, 17^th^ record also has an additional
typo. The lab will use these lines to demonstrate how to handle parsing
errors.

 +

 +

*5.4* Override the following method from the abstract class:

 +

@Override

public String readItem() \{

String string = null;

try \{

string = reader.readLine();

} catch (IOException ex) \{

ex.printStackTrace();

}

return string;

}

 +

The readItem method returns the next item from the stream. It returns
null to indicate end of stream. Note end of stream indicates end of
chunk, so the

current chunk will be committed and the step will end.

Resolve the imports.

 +
 +

*5.5* Right-click on “org.glassfish.movieplex7.batch” package, select
“New”, “Java Class…”, specify the name as “SalesProcessor”. Change the
class definition and add:

 +

implements ItemProcessor

 +

ItemProcessor is an interface that defines a method that is used to
operate on an input item and produce an output item. This processor
accepts a String input item from the reader, SalesReader in our case,
and returns a Sales instance to the writer (coming shortly). Sales is
the pre-packaged JPA entity with the application starter source code.

 +

Add @Named and @Dependent as class-level annotations so that it allows
the bean to be injected in Job XML.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.6* Add implementation of the abstract method from the interface as:

 +

@Override

public Sales processItem(Object s) \{

Sales sales = new Sales();

StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer((String)s, ",");

sales.setId(Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken()));

sales.setAmount(Float.parseFloat(tokens.nextToken()));

return sales;

}

 +

This method takes a String parameter coming from the SalesReader, parses
the value, populates them in the Sales instance, and returns it. This is
then aggregated with the writer.

 +

The method can return null indicating that the item should not be
aggregated. For example, the parsing errors can be handled within the
method and return null if the values are not correct. However this
method is implemented where any parsing errors are thrown as exception.
Job XML can be instructed to skip these exceptions and thus that
particular record is skipped from aggregation as well (shown later).

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.7* Right-click on “org.glassfish.movieplex7.batch” package, select
“New”, “Java Class…”, specify the name as “SalesWriter”. Change the
class definition and add:

 +

extends AbstractItemWriter

 +

AbstractItemWriter is an abstract class that implements ItemWriter
interface. The ItemWriter interface defines methods that write to a
stream of items for chunk processing. This writer writes a list of Sales
items.

 +

Add @Named and @Dependent as class-level annotations so that it allows
the bean to be injected in Job XML.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.8* Inject EntityManager as:

 +

@PersistenceContext EntityManager em;

 +

Override the following method from the abstract class:

 +

@Override

@Transactional

public void writeItems(List list) \{

for (Sales s : (List<Sales>)list) \{

em.persist(s);

}

}

 +

Batch runtime aggregates the list of Sales instances returned from the
SalesProessor and makes it available as List in this method. This method
iterates over the list and persist each item in the database.

 +

The method also specifies @Transactional as a method level annotation.
This is a new annotation introduced by JTA 1.2 that provides the ability
to control transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans. This provides
the semantics of EJB transaction attributes in CDI beans without
dependencies such as RMI. This support is implemented via an
implementation of a CDI interceptor that conducts the necessary
suspending, resuming, etc. 

 +

In this case, a transaction is automatically started before the method
is called, committed if no checked exceptions are thrown, and rolled
back if runtime exceptions are thrown. This behavior can be overridden
using rollbackOn and dontRollbackOn attributes of the annotation.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.9* Create Job XML that defines the job, step, and chunk.

 +

In “Files” tab, expand the project -> “src” -> “main” -> “resources”,
right-click on “resources”, “META-INF”, select “New”, “Folder…”, specify
the name as “batch-jobs”, and click on “Finish”.

 +

Right-click on the newly created folder, select “New”, “Other…”, select
“XML”, “XML Document”, click on “Next >”, give the name as “eod-sales”,
click on “Next”, take the default, and click on “Finish”.

 +

Replace contents of the file with the following:

 +

<job id="endOfDaySales"
xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee[http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee]"
version="1.0">

<step id="populateSales">

<chunk item-count="3" skip-limit="5">

<reader ref="salesReader"/>

<processor ref="salesProcessor"/>

<writer ref="salesWriter"/>

<skippable-exception-classes>

<include class="java.lang.NumberFormatException"/>

</skippable-exception-classes>

</chunk>

</step>

</job>

 +

 +

This code shows that the job has one step of chunk type. The <reader>,
<processor>, and <writer> elements define the CDI bean name of the
implementations of ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter interfaces.
The item-count attribute defines that 3 items are
read/processed/aggregated and then given to the writer. The entire
reader/processor/writer cycle is executed within a transaction. The
<skippable-exception-classes> element specifies a set of exceptions to
be skipped by chunk processing.

 +

CSV file used for this lab has intentionally introduced couple of typos
that would generate NumberFormatException. Specifying this element
allows skipping the exception, ignore that particular element, and
continue processing. If this element is not specified then the batch
processing will halt. The skip-limit attribute specifies the number of
exceptions a step will skip.

 +

*5.10* Lets invoke the batch job.

 +

Right-click on “org.glassfish.movieplex7.batch” package, select “New”,
“Java Class…”. Enter the name as “SalesBean” and click on “Finish”
button.

 +

Add the following code to the bean:

 +

public void runJob() \{

try \{

JobOperator jo = BatchRuntime.getJobOperator();

long jobId = jo.start("eod-sales", new Properties());

System.out.println("Started job: with id: " + jobId);

} catch (JobStartException ex) \{

ex.printStackTrace();

}

}

 +

This method uses BatchRuntime to get an instance of JobOperator, which
is then used to start the job. JobOperator is the interface for
operating on batch jobs. It can be used to start, stop, and restart
jobs. It can additionally inspect job history, to discover what jobs are
currently running and what jobs have previously run.

 +

Add @Named and @RequestScoped as class-level annotations. This allows
the bean to be injectable in an EL expression.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

image:images/5.10-imports.png[image]

 +

*5.11* Inject EntityManagerFactory in the class as:

 +

@PersistenceUnit EntityManagerFactory emf;

 +

and add the following method:

 +

public List<Sales> getSalesData() \{

return emf.createEntityManager().createNamedQuery("Sales.findAll",
Sales.class).getResultList();

}

 +

This method uses a pre-defined @NamedQuery to query the database and
return all the rows from the table.

 +

Resolve the imports.

 +

 +

*5.12* Right-click on “Web Pages”, select “New”, “Folder…”, specify the
name as “batch”, and click on “Finish”.

 +

Right-click on the newly created folder, select “New”, “Other…”,
“JavaServer Faces”, “Facelets Template Client”, and click on “Next >”.

 +

Give the File Name as “sales”. Click on “Browse…” next to “Template:”,
expand “Web Pages”, “WEB-INF”, select “template.xhtml”, and click on
“Select File”. Click on “Finish”.

 +

In this file, remove <ui:define> sections where name attribute value is
“top” and “left”. These sections are inherited from the template.

 +

Replace <ui:define> section with “content” name such that it looks like:

 +

 +

<ui:define name=”content”>

<h1>Movie Sales</h1>

<h:form>

<h:dataTable value="#\{salesBean.salesData}" var="s" border="1">

<h:column>

<f:facet name="header">

<h:outputText value="Show ID" />

</f:facet>

#\{s.id}

</h:column>

<h:column>

<f:facet name="header">

<h:outputText value="Sales" />

</f:facet>

#\{s.amount}

</h:column>

</h:dataTable>

 +

<h:commandButton value="Run Job" action="sales"
actionListener="#\{salesBean.runJob()}"/>

<h:commandButton value="Refresh" action="sales" />

</h:form>

</ui:define>

 +

This code displays the show identifier and sales from that show in a
table by invoking SalesBean.getSalesData(). First command button allows
invoking the job that processes the CSV file and populates the database.
The second command button refreshes the page.

 +

Right-click on the yellow bulb to fix namespace prefix/URI mapping. This
needs to be repeated for h: and f: prefix.

 +

 +

*5.13* Add the following code in “template.xhtml” along with other
<outputLink>s:

 +

<p/><h:outputLink
value="$\{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/faces/batch/sales.xhtml">Sales</h:outputLink>

 +

 +

*5.14* Run the project to see the output as shown.

 +

image:images/5.14-sales.png[image]

 +

Notice, a new “Sales” entry is displayed in the left navigation bar.

 +

 +

*5.15* Click on “Sales” to see the output as shown.

 +

image:images/5.15-sales.png[image]

 +

The empty table indicates that there is no sales data in the database.

 +

 +

*5.16* Click on “Run Job” button to initiate data processing of CSV
file. Look for “Waiting for localhost...” in the browser status bar,
wait for a couple of seconds for the processing to finish, and then
click on “Refresh” button to see the updated output as shown.

 +

image:images/5.16-sales-output.png[image]

 +

 +

Now the table is populated with the sales data.

 +

Note that record 5 is missing from the table, as this records did not
have correct numeric entries for the sales total. The Job XML for the
application explicitly mentioned to skip such errors.
